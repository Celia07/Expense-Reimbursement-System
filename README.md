Project 1: Expense Reimbursement System
Executive Summary
The Expense Reimbursement System (ERS) will manage the process of reimbursing employees for expenses incurred while on company time. All employees in the company can login and submit requests for reimbursement and view their past tickets and pending requests. Finance managers can log in and view all reimbursement requests and past history for all employees in the company. Finance managers are authorized to approve and deny requests for expense reimbursement.

Technical Requirements
The application shall employ the DAO design pattern, and properly separate your code into the appropriate layers, (Models, DAO, Service, Controllers, Views)
The back-end system shall use JDBC to talk to the Database
The java backend shall use Javalin to create the webserver, and process HTTP requests from the client
The java and Javalin backend shall be deployed to a google cloud compute engine
The front-end view can use JavaScript and use AJAX to call server-side components. The web pages should look presentable (try using css and bootstrap); Iâ€™d rather not see a website from 1995.
The front-end shall be deployed on a google cloud storage bucket
Use Log4J and JUnit. There MUST be 75% code coverage of your service methods
(OPTIONAL) Passwords should be encrypted in Java and securely stored in the database
(OPTIONAL) Users can upload a document or image of their receipt when submitting reimbursements(optional)
(OPTIONAL) The application will send an email to employees letting them know that they have been registered as a new user, giving them their temporary password
